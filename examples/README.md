# Examples and example scripts

Depends on the following packages:

- [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) : `wp.sh`
- [tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi) : `tofi-bg.sh`

Descriptions:

- [`wp.sh`](wp.sh) change wallpaper based on a list of files (recommendation -> link/copy to `/usr/bin/wp` or some other place, so that `tofi-bg.sh` finds it)
- [`tofi-bg.sh`](wp.sh) use `tofi` to nicely list tags. when a selection happens, change the wallpaper using `wp` (for it to work properly your tags can't have spaces in them, yet)
